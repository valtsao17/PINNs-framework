# PINNs-framework

## Overview
This repository is an ongoing development of a framework that involves using PINNs (Physics Informed Neural Networks) to solve both forward and inverse problems. The idea of PINNs was introduced by Raissi in 2019 as a method of embedding knowledge of physical systems into neural networks so that they may more effectively learn the analytical solution. 


### Benchmark
For the application of environmental forensics, pollutant tracking or source identification is particularly of interest. As a benchmark case, this study will look at the advection diffusion PDE in 1D, which can be described with
\begin{aligned}
& u_t = c^2 u_{xx} - \beta u_x 
\end{aligned}
